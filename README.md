# whatsapp_bot

In this i have done a basic whatsapp bot, which gives automatic replies. 
To create an whatsapp bot we need to have a bussiness account in whatsapp. 
What if you dont want to do all those lengthy process? Is there any way for developers ? 
Yes! we have a way, **twilio**(website) allows users to create free bussiness account, without need of any authorization from whatsapp. 
Twilio sandbox for whatsapp allows you to test and prototype messaging via whatsapp using Twilio app. cool! Right.

It works now , what if you need your bot works continuosly, we need a server right! So, i am using ngrok server which provides the public url for temperory purpose( min 6-8 hrs).
I have used Ngrok.exe to run my bot, If ur bot works fine and if u satisfied with yr bot. Try to deploy yr project in Cloud Platforms Like 'HEROKU', "AWS"...etc.....
